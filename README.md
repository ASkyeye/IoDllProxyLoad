# IoDllProxyLoad

 This project is an example of weaponizing the Windows thread pool API to proxy the loading of a DLL through an I/O completion callback function utilizing named pipes and C++/assembly to produce a clean stack for the DLL load. I wrote a detailed blog about this project [here](https://fin3ss3g0d.net/index.php/2024/03/18/weaponizing-windows-thread-pool-apis-proxying-dll-loads/).
